## Comp 551 Mini-project 4: Reproducible Machine Learning
### Group 10: Beatrice Lopez, Minh Anh Nguyen, Siyun Liao
### An Analysis of Baselines for the Sentiment Classification Task

#### Setup instructions

The networks are run in Google Colab to take advantage of the GPU.

On Google Drive, the folder structure should be
- My Drive
  - Colab Notebooks
    - dataset
      - yelp2013.csv
      - yelp2014.csv
      - yelp2015.csv
    - SVM_Yelp2013.ipynb
    - SVM_Yelp2014.ipynb
    - SVM_Yelp2015.ipynb
    - logistic_regression.ipynb

##### logistic_regression.ipynb contains the logistic regression models for all 3 Yelp datasets.
##### SVM_Yelp{2013,2014,2015}.ipynb contains the SVM models for the Yelp {2013,2014,2015} dataset. We separated them to record and display the accuracies in each notebook.

The Yelp datasets are taken from https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge.
